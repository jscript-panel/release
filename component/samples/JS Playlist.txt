[Loving tracks on Last.fm with foo_lastfm_playcount_sync]
It's now possible to love/unlove tracks on Last.fm directly from clicking on the hearts in the MOOD column. This feature can be enabled
in the Properties window. Hold Shift + Winkey before right clicking. The option is named "Love tracks with foo_lastfm_playcount_sync".

Prerequisites:

You must have foo_lastfm_playcount_sync installed, configured and authenticated with your Last.fm account.

https://github.com/marc2k3/foo_jscript_panel/wiki/Other-Components

You must have imported your Last.fm loved tracks via the main Library menu because it works as a toggle for the current value.
You must enable the MOOD column and configure it in the settings to display %lfm_loved%. Ensure this is displaying your imported
loved tracks as expected before clicking anything!

Usage:

Now when you click the heart, it loves/unloves tracks directly on Last.fm. Only a succesful response from Last.fm will make the icon update.
Check the foobar2000 Console for messages if not working as expected.
