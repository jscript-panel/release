!!! note "Note for JScript Panel v2 users"
	Because of the massive changes, this component is named
	`JScript Panel 3 (foo_jscript_panel3.dll)` and will
	not override any previous `JScript Panel` installation. It
	will install side by side. There is no way to upgrade
	and scripts will require significant changes to be
	compatible.

	The biggest change is the reworking of all graphics and image
	handling which are detailed on the [changes](changes) page.

	`JScript Panel v2` is still available for download [here](https://github.com/marc2k3/foo_jscript_panel/releases).

## Minimum requirements

`Windows 7` is the current minimum requirement. The minimum requirement
for [foobar2000](https://foobar2000.org) is `v1.5`.

Both `Default UI` and [Columns UI](https://yuo.be/columns-ui) are supported.

!!! note
	If running `Windows 7`, it should be fully updated. At the very least, `IE9`
	and the [Platform Update](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36805) need to be installed.

## Samples

Since the learning curve for writing your own scripts is quite steep, there
are many included samples that don't require any knowledge at all. You
can simply pick the one you want to use from the `Samples` menu in
the [Configuration Window](configuration-window). See the
[Gallery](../gallery) for some screenshots.

Nearly all included samples require the installation of `FontAwesome` which
you can grab here:
